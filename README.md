# C-Number-Sequence-Function
This repository contains a set of functions in C to work with natural numbers, even numbers, odd numbers, and their sums. The functions demonstrate basic looping, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.

## Features
- Print natural numbers from 1 to `n`.
- Print reverse natural numbers from `n` to 1.
- Print even and odd numbers up to `n`.
- Calculate the sum of natural numbers, even numbers, and odd numbers up to `n`.

## Code Explanation
The following functions are implemented in the `main.c` file:

- `naturalNumbers(int n)`: Prints natural numbers from 1 to `n`.
- `reverseNaturalNumbers(int n)`: Prints reverse natural numbers from `n` to 1.
- `evenNumbers(int n)`: Prints even numbers from 2 to `n`.
- `oddNumbers(int n)`: Prints odd numbers from 1 to `n`.
- `sumNaturalNumbers(int n)`: Calculates the sum of natural numbers from 1 to `n`.
- `sumEvenNumbers(int n)`: Calculates the sum of even numbers from 2 to `n`.
- `sumOddNumbers(int n)`: Calculates the sum of odd numbers from 1 to `n`.

## Example Output
Here are some example outputs for various functions with `n` set to 10:

- Natural numbers from 1 to 10 are: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10`
- Reverse natural numbers from 10 to 1 are: `10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1`
- Even numbers from 1 to 10 are: `2 4 6 8 10`
- Odd numbers from 1 to 10 are: `1 3 5 7 9`
- Sum of natural numbers from 1 to 10 is: `55`
- Sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is: `30`
- Sum of odd numbers from 1 to 10 is: `25`
